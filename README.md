# Robot
Accept a set of commands and then simulate whether an object can move without going outside the given area. 
The object cannot reenter the area to "save" the end result.

Input: 
● The size of the table as two integers [width, height]
● The objects starting position as two integers [x, y]

Output:
● If the simulation succeeded: The objects final position as two integers [x, y].
● If the simulation failed: [-1, -1] should be returned
